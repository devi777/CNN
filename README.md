# CNN
It comprises of 2 Jupyter notebooks:

1. Malaria Detection
  
  >The dataset contains 2 folders - Infected/Uninfected, and a total of 27,558 images.
 
  > Save humans by detecting and deploying Image Cells that contain Malaria or not!
  > Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria
  
  > Training Accuracy: 94%
 
 2. MNIST Character Detection 
 
  > MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “Hello World” dataset of computer vision. The MNIST     > database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It   > is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
  
  > Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv
  
  > Training Accuracy: 99%, Test Accuracy: 98% 

 3. CIFAR-10
 
   > The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each clas

  > **VGG** Training Accuracy: 98%, Test Accuracy: 70%  
  > **AlexNet** Training Accuracy: 89.45%, Test Accuracy: 78%
